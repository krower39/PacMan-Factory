# PacMan-Factory
Create a bunch of bouncing PacMen on the screen
This was an assignment from class to build on factory creation concepts, Java image changing and positions on the DOMS

**How to run**
Click the "Add PacMan" button to create a new PacMan. Once you have clicked enough PacMan into existance, you can click the start button to see them start to bounce and change direction on screen.

Future Plans
None on this, I think getting the concept to work is cool but I am unsure of how to turn this into work applications.
